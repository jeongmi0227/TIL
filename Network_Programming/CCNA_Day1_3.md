### Day1

A client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server.
A server is a device that provides functions or services for clients.
The same device can be a client in some situations, and a server in other situations.

Switches characteristics
- Have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to (usually 24+).
- Provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN(local area network).
- Do not provide connectivity between LANs/over the Internet.
- Aggregate the connections to a device called a switch.

Routers characteristics
- Have fewer network interfaces than switches
- Are used to provide connectivity between LANs.
- Are therefore used to send data over the Internet.

 Firewalls characteristics 
firewalls are specialty network security devices that control network traffic entering and exiting your network. firewalls can be placed 'outside' of the router or 'inside' of network. Protect the end hosts inside.
- Monitor and control network traffic based on configured ruels.
- Can be placed 'inside' the network, or 'outside the network'
- Are known as 'Next-Generation Firewalls' when they include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities.

Network firewalls are hardware devices that filter traffic between networks.
Host-based firewalls are software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC.
A next-generation firewall combines traditional firewall features with more advanced filtering functionalities.

### Day2

The connections between devices in a network operate at a set speed.
These speeds are measured in bits per second.
When communicating across a cooper network cable, a variation in the electrical signal is interpreted by the receiving device as 0 or 1.

8 bits = 1 byte
